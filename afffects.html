            <li>ISPs can charge you depnding on what your doing. (ie. If your watching Netflix they can charge you more than if you are reading from 9news.)</li>
            <li>ISPs can block websites that don't reflect their veiws. (ie. Lets say an internet company is far left, they could block all the websites that lean right.)</li>
            <li>ISPs will be able to charge you based on the amount of data you use per month. (ie. Essentially it would be like phone plans right now.)</li>
            <li>You also may experience slow downs on certain websites because a company can't afford to pay the ISP to be in their fast lane. This fast would make all the companies that pay for load their websites faster, while slowing down everyone else.</li>

            <li>Our right to the freedom of press will be violated! There won't nessacarily be freedom of the press because they will be blocked by ISPs who have different veiws or they might just be slowed down to a point that is to slow to be usable.</li>
            <li>Our right to speak freely will also be violated! We won't be able to communicate without paying for special packages. Also small blogs won't be able to start up because theyy won't be able to afford to be in the "Fast Lane".</li>
            <li>Also, it violates a right in the fact that the public welfare, which is assumed in the 9th ammendment because it says it in the preamble. This violates our welfare because to be happy we need a internet with Net Neutrality.</li>

          <ol class="flow-text white-text">
            <li>The market won't change because the companies will get to much backlash if they switch pricing models.</li>

                <li>I don't think this is feesable because companies are too greedy and only care about making as much money as possible.</li>

            <li>ISPs also argue that we have a free market.</li>
              <ol type="a">
                <li>Well our market isn't a true capitalist market ass we have restrictions. Net Neutrality is a restriction that is good for customers and makes companies lose a ton of possible profits. Since, we aren't a complete free market we can restrict ISPs with Net Neutrality, so that the internet will remain open, fair, and free.</li>
